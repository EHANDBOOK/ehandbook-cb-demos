== Function Overview

This document describes a simple C-Code function that performs basic arithmetic operations. The function takes two integer inputs, **in1** and **in2**, and produces two outputs, **sig1** and **sig2**, based on a series of calculations.

=== Core Operations

The function executes the following sequence of operations:

1.  **Addition:** The **add** function is called to sum the two input values, **in1** and **in2**. The result is stored in a local variable **loc1**.
2.  **Subtraction:** The **sub** function is called to subtract **in1** from the result of the addition (**loc1**). The result is stored in **loc2**.
3.  **Multiplication:** The **mul** function is called to multiply **loc1** and **loc2**. The result is assigned to the output signal **sig1**.
4.  **Division:** The **div** function is called to divide **loc1** by **loc2**. The result is assigned to the output signal **sig2**.

=== Helper Functions

The module includes two local helper functions:

*   **add(summand1, summand2)**: Returns the sum of two integers.
*   **sub(minuend, subtrahend)**: Returns the difference between two integers.

The functions **mul** and **div** are expected to be provided by an external library or another source file.
