In the module FuelMass the required fuel mass Fmc_mFuel_Sim for the combustion is calculated. For this, the ration of air mass in the cylinder Amf_mAirPerStr_Sim and the air-fuel-ratio Afr_facRatio_Sim is calculated and multiplied with the correction factor Lcc_facLambdaCorr_Sim from the lambda control.
