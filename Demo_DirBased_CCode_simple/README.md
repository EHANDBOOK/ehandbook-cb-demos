# Demo: Directory-based EHB-CB for Simple C-Code Functions

**Objective:** This demo illustrates how to use the directory-based EHANDBOOK Container-Build to generate a container from two simple ECU functions implemented in C-Code.

---

## ✨ Features Showcased

*   Directory-based input structure for a project with multiple C-Code functions.
*   Processing of two separate C-Code functions (`Function1` and `Function2`) in a single build.
*   Use of AsciiDoc (`.adoc`) files for textual documentation for each function.
*   Use of Excel files (`.xlsx`) for interface specification.
*   Inclusion of a shared C-Code library (`CCodeLib`).

---

## 🛠️ How to Run

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   EHANDBOOK Container-Build with a suitable license for the C-Code converter.
    *   Ensure you have run the `set_tool_paths.bat` script in the repository root.

2.  **Build:**
    *   Open a command prompt or terminal.
    *   Navigate to this directory.
    *   Execute the `build.bat` script.

## 🔬 Explore the Output

*   After the build completes, navigate to the `Output/` folder.
*   Open the generated EHANDBOOK file to see the two C-Code functions integrated into one container.

## ⚙️ Under the Hood

This demo provides a basic example of how to structure a directory-based build for a project with multiple C-Code components.

### Directory Structure

*   **`Input/`**: Contains the source artifacts for each function, organized into subdirectories.
    *   **`Function1/`**: Contains the artifacts for the first function, including its C-Code (`test.c`), documentation (`function1.adoc`), and interface definition (`if.xlsx`).
    *   **`Function2/`**: Contains the artifacts for the second function, including its C-Code (`Func2.c`), documentation (`function2.adoc`), and interface definition (`if.xlsx`).
*   **`CCodeConfig/`**: This folder can hold a `CCodeConfig.json` file to provide specific configuration parameters for the C-Code converter.
*   **`CCodeLib/`**: This folder contains a shared library (`mul_div.c`) that provides common functions (`mul`, `div`) used by the other C-Code modules.
*   **`Output/`**: This is the destination folder where the generated EHANDBOOK will be saved.
*   **`build.bat`**: This script runs the EHANDBOOK Container-Build process.
