== Function Overview

ehbfunctionoverview::"Function"["Function"]

This is the documentation for function.

== Description

The function calculates provides two services:

1. The calculation of the sum of two inputs a and b
2. The product of two further inputs, x1 and x2

== Structure

The services are realized in two subsystems which are included as so-called *referenced models*.

== Example blocks from Simulink libary

The function also includes a subsystem with a few blocks with a complex graphical rendering from the Simulink library. 
To represent the blocks adequately in EHANDBOOK, EHANDBOOK Container-Build generates icons with the help of MATLAB connection and applies them on top of the blocks.
While generating icon graphics for blocks does take some time, this provides very good graphical representation and readability.
